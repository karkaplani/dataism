# Data Analyses
Couple of reports for the data analyses done for the BI & Data Analytics course. All of them were done using machine learning algorithms, which were taught in the course and practiced with weekly labs, in Weka with the help of Excel for data preparation. The carjacking analysis is by far the most important and thorough one. All the projects were done with my excellent partner for the entire term, Elaiza Rivera.

## Outcomes
- Getting familiarized with different machine learning algorithms
- Following CRISP-DM standards
- Detecting outliers
- Making meaningful analyses 
- Writing thorough analysis reports
- Using Excel for data preparation
- Using Weka to apply algorithms
- Visualizing data 
- Fundamental knowledge on statistics

## Algorithms Practiced
- kNN
- Classification - Decision Trees
- Clustering - kMeans
- Regression
- Outlier Detection - ISF & LOF
- Association Rule Mining (Apriori)

## Projects
For all of the analyses, raw data sets were prepared (Cleaning, handling empty values, outlier detection etc.), different algorithms in different ways applied, statistics were tabulated and data visualizations were done. Every steps were reported.

### [Seeds](https://github.com/karkaplani/dataism/blob/main/ML/1-seeds.pdf)
Selected a proper dataset from given options and applied kNN with different folds and seeds to get the best results for clustering different attributes

### [Titanic](https://github.com/karkaplani/dataism/blob/main/ML/2-titanic.pdf)
Classical Titanic Victims analysis to see what groups of people are more or less likely to survive from the incident, using decision trees

### [Satellite](https://github.com/karkaplani/dataism/blob/main/ML/3-satellite.pdf)
An analysis focusing on Anomaly Detection

### [Detroit Carjacking](https://github.com/karkaplani/dataism/blob/main/ML/4-carjacking.pdf)
The mightiest one of all the analyses made. Whole analysis from finding a dataset to inferring meaningful and practical results including how to use which algorithms were done me and my partner. Every step including the thinking processes were reported thoroughly in detail, and presented in a class in addition to the report.
