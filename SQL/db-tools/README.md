# Tools Section
Throughout the second Database course (Database Systems) we got familiarized with using different RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) graphical user interface tools with weekly labs to practice PL/SQL at the same time in addition to PostgreSQL, which was used for the first Database course.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Access
- Microsoft SQL Server 
- MySQL Workbench (Although not many labs here, this is the main RDBMS used for the [advance Java courses](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java))
- Oracle SQL Developer.

## Outcomes
- Installing and configuring different database tools
- Practicing PL/SQL statements (Stored procedures, Triggers, Packages)
- Solving various none code-related problems
- Getting familiar with different RDBMS and a bit about the SQL differentiating between them
