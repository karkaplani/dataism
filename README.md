# Dataism
As one of the followers of the disciples of the religion of the modern age, "Dataism", I'm publishing this repository including all the notable work I have done for the data-related courses in my two years of study in Algonquin College. The terms except the third one, there were mandatory courses to complete the program, and for the third term I chose the BI & Data Analytics course as my elective since I was interested in machine learning as well. All the courses were passed with straight A+ after all the hard work.

## SQL
This section summarizes the work done for the three mandatory courses. The first one is all about SQL and Database Design, the second is more advanced PL/SQL and using different management systems, and the third one is on more advanced topics like Database Administration or SQL tuning in Oracle.

## Analyses
The analyses done for the elective course were gathered there. All the data analysis steps and various Machine Learning algorithms were practiced. They also had a significant impact on my technical writing and teamworking skills. 

## Applications
Having completed a diploma program mainly on backend web development, there are plenty of applications that have database connection developed by myself. They are not included in this repository, and have their own repositories.

1. [Readability Checker:]() Mainly a machine learning project using a fine-tuned and pre-trained NLP (Natural Language Processing) model via Python, and the web application to use this model for classifying the readability of a given text 

2. [Covid Manager:](https://github.com/karkaplani/covid-manager) Perhaps the hugest application developed by me following MERN stack, so having a MongoDB connection to manage and visualize Canada's 2020 Covid19 data

3. [Advanced Java:](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java) A section from my java-journey repository which the Java applications working with a MySQL database were brought together

4. [Resto Finder:](https://github.com/karkaplani/Resto-Finder) A full-stack web application having a MongoDB connection to find an display the restaurants on a map after a given keyword, zip code and radius

5. [Triviapo:](https://github.com/karkaplani/triviapo) A trivia game developed using Kotlin for Android, and having an SQLite database to save the user stats
